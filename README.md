# Vintage-Online-Store
The Vintage Online Store Annual Report project was designed to analyze and present the annual performance data of an online store specializing in vintage products. The project included an in-depth study of sales trends, product category performance, customer demographics, and seasonal profitability.

Using advanced Excel tools like pivot tables, slicers, conditional formatting, and charts, I created a dynamic and interactive report. This report helped visualize key metrics such as total revenue, customer retention rates, and top-performing products, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.
